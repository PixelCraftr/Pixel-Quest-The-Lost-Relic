Hey before you download the game

the lila.cpython-39.pyc is the main file which you can play the game
BUT there is something wrong with it, the vs code is fine but if you play it on GitHub and Github's VS Code then it wont work.

Just saying so if you wondering when playing the game wont work then this is your answer
and just to warn ya so your PC will still have some spaces and not waste it for something that doesnt work!
